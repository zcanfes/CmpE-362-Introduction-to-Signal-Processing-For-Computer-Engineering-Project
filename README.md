# CmpE-362-Introduction-to-Signal-Processing-For-Computer-Engineering-Project

Signal processing is a concept scattered all around our lives. From images to music pieces, all
consist of signals in their cores. From all the concepts related to signals, music caught our attention at
most. As hardworking Cmpe students, relaxing music pieces accompany us for the long nights and
cheers up after heart-breaking finals. Moreover, when one feels depressed or overwhelmed, spending
some time with a musical instrument is the perfect cure.
Throughout the course, we have seen different representations of signals and various ways of
manipulating them. However, we used default sine or cos functions to study on. Obviously it is better to
use harmonic waves to observe effects of filters and other operations, but this is not the case for the
real music pieces. We wanted to implement our cumulative knowledge to the music pieces and have
some real-life results.


## Description
We used matlab and some digital signal processing methods to manipulate music
files in this project. We read the music signals from a file and processed the file with some digital
signal processing methods. We created a system like an equalizer. It can reverse sounds. It can
boost amplitudes of the sound. It can boost the bass on the sound. It can create a 7D sound
experience and it can combine multiple sounds. It can also save the processed sounds on
separate files. To achieve all these functionalities, we read the file in amplitude domain and we
converted the signal into frequency domain.
